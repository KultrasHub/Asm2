            "Cyber security professional has a sort of simple daily routine. Each day could be the same, sometimes there is a little difference for urgent situations. The man named himself for his Youtube channel is DC Cybersec. Each simple day begins with a cup of coffee and spends time walking with his dog around his department while brewing his coffee. Then, the Cyber Security goes straight to the workplace as soon as it starts at 8:00 AM. First thing is done every morning at work is about to go through all the emails to check for urgents, if there is any urgent, it could be done on the spot, if there is none, he will continue working with his colleagues who could be a cyber security. They are working on Security Matrix and trying to hack the matrix. The process could be analyzing what could harm the system, particularly what kind of threat it is, how many solutions there are, and what it will harm. Then, they put them on the scale level from 1 to 5 (harmless to mostly dangerous) and then coding to figure it out. Time in the morning is about to work and figure the problem. Time in the afternoon which is meeting, he meets his managers or clients to keep track on the problem they are working on to let them know that the process is going positively or negatively in order to handle the problem as soon as possible. Work ends at 3:30, which means 7 and a half hours working at the workplace. The rest of the day, he spends time with his friends and then go to rest. It sounds pretty much perfect and not any hurdles for the Professional. ",
            "This is video is about a woman IT Professional who is know working as business analyst. She starts a day from very soon in the morning which is 5:45 A.M to work out. Work out in the morning helps to release all endorphins and stress to free your brain and push up your energy for the new day starting. Taking care of her dogs and eating breakfast, checking for emergency emails to reply. Although it is just 8:00 A.M in the morning, she has already had a call from her clients. A busy day for the lady from 8 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon while she needs to be on phone contacting with different clients doing business in IT area. Other days, she can have meetings with her co-workers if she does not have any calls. It seems very exhausted for a business analyst in IT area while in the video the lady does not have any time for eating. Her lunch was done while she is on her talking on just a little piece of bread. Her work ends at 4:00 P.M and then she just goes straight home to take care of her dogs again. After arriving home, she still needs to have all her own work done before it is too late in the evening. Like responding emails, edit videos for Youtube channel, studying more for her jobs or something she likes. Not until doing household like cleaning kitchen with all the mess she left in the morning, she goes to bed before 11:00 P.M. Because all the IT professional always sleep before 11:00 PM if there is not any hurdle or urgent works need to be done."
