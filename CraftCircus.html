              I am not an organized type of person, I prefer messiness due to the comfort it brings. However, I follow a habbit so that I would not miss any work. It explains why I am usually chosen as a leader. <br> <br> The second result suggests that I learn best through action. It is true as I am extremely impatient toward verbal and writen introduction and most of the time, I just want to do the work immediately. <br><br> I am not a idea generator, I usually have innovative ideas based on existed concepts in most cases. Therefore, I have my best performance when there is given concept to explore. As the chart suggests, my curiousity is genuinely high, this means I excel at explore an idea rather than creating new one.

              From the 16 personalities results it showed me that I am more of an emotion-driven person, most of the time my actions will reflect back on how I feel about it more than how I think about it, since my intuition is 62% showing that I also sometimes understand things without the present of the conscious reasoning behind it. <br><br> The test results shows that in order for me to learn I have to physically take part in doing them to progress, I will have a hard time if it is from hearing through ears or through reading, expressing myself is a challenge for me since I will be using my hand gestures more when I express my ideas and I do not have a specific sitting pose. I do not like to sit or stand still when I am bored and breaking down things before rebuilding them up intrigues me. I really like physical form encouragement such as high-fiving or pat on the back. I have to interact with the problem in order to learn about it. When in a team I will be listening to the team while walking around and taking notes to remind myself about the details that are being put out by my members. <br><br> Overall the result shows that my creativity is not that high so as most of the specific traits inside the creativity graph. The only trait that I slightly excel at is Perspective, being able to persuade others, change their perspective of the situation by presenting my own thoughts and thinking process.

              When I tested an online application on a browser about my personality and my learning style, I have recognized a lot of things about myself which I do not know about until they analyze me. Firstly, it is the 16Personalities testing my traits and the result definitely surprises me. The result in general is telling me that I am very energetic in everything and working with feelings, following my heart more than following my head. I am quite worried about this part of mine. I know that I am judging everything by my feelings but sometimes just following my heart only hurts myself and my life. Fortunately, I have not done anything which makes me disappointed yet. Moreover, this test will explain reasonably why I am a tactile/kinesthetic. This style of learning is about combining movements and studyings altogether to imagine how the study will flow in my brain. My last test from Big Five, the in the OCEAN, I am most of the A which means Agreeableness. It means a person with high A will trust their people, always care about others explaining how sympathetic I am which means how I am working with feelings more than logic.
