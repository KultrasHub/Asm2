              I am not an organized type of person, I prefer messiness due to the comfort it brings. However, I follow a habbit so that I would not miss any work. It explains why I am usually chosen as a leader. <br> <br> The second result suggests that I learn best through action. It is true as I am extremely impatient toward verbal and writen introduction and most of the time, I just want to do the work immediately. <br><br> I am not a idea generator, I usually have innovative ideas based on existed concepts in most cases. Therefore, I have my best performance when there is given concept to explore. As the chart suggests, my curiousity is genuinely high, this means I excel at explore an idea rather than creating new one.

            To be honest, I believe these results test is some part reflect my true personality but not because of that I change myself. In fact, I love myself being now cause all my friend love me and I love that. Also I find it no hard to make new friend so I keep my lifestyle like this. <br> <br> It does not influence my behaviour in my team at least, I have to do and need for my teammate. <br> <br> My strengths are creativity, confidence and the ability to self-study so the teammates that I choose each of them are good at skills I don't have like Java(script), C#(++),... and especially being able to identify right and wrong because I usually do it without knowing whether it is allowed or not, I just do it with all the creativity I can think of.

              From the 16 personalities results it showed me that I am more of an emotion-driven person, most of the time my actions will reflect back on how I feel about it more than how I think about it, since my intuition is 62% showing that I also sometimes understand things without the present of the conscious reasoning behind it. <br><br> The test results shows that in order for me to learn I have to physically take part in doing them to progress, I will have a hard time if it is from hearing through ears or through reading, expressing myself is a challenge for me since I will be using my hand gestures more when I express my ideas and I do not have a specific sitting pose. I do not like to sit or stand still when I am bored and breaking down things before rebuilding them up intrigues me. I really like physical form encouragement such as high-fiving or pat on the back. I have to interact with the problem in order to learn about it. When in a team I will be listening to the team while walking around and taking notes to remind myself about the details that are being put out by my members. <br><br> Overall the result shows that my creativity is not that high so as most of the specific traits inside the creativity graph. The only trait that I slightly excel at is Perspective, being able to persuade others, change their perspective of the situation by presenting my own thoughts and thinking process.

              When I tested an online application on a browser about my personality and my learning style, I have recognized a lot of things about myself which I do not know about until they analyze me. Firstly, it is the 16Personalities testing my traits and the result definitely surprises me. The result in general is telling me that I am very energetic in everything and working with feelings, following my heart more than following my head. I am quite worried about this part of mine. I know that I am judging everything by my feelings but sometimes just following my heart only hurts myself and my life. <br><br> Fortunately, I have not done anything which makes me disappointed yet. Moreover, this test will explain reasonably why I am a tactile/kinesthetic. This style of learning is about combining movements and studyings altogether to imagine how the study will flow in my brain. <br> <br> My last test from Big Five, the in the OCEAN, I am most of the A which means Agreeableness. It means a person with high A will trust their people, always care about others explaining how sympathetic I am which means how I am working with feelings more than logic.
