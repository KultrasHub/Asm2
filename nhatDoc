Cyber security professional has a sort of simple daily routine. Each day could be the same, sometimes there is a little difference for urgent situations. 
The man named himself for his Youtube channel is DC Cybersec. Each simple day begins with a cup of coffee and spends time walking with his dog around his department
while brewing his coffee. Then, the Cyber Security goes straight to the workplace as soon as it starts at 8:00 AM. First thing is done every morning at work is about to go
through all the emails to check for urgents, if there is any urgent, it could be done on the spot, if there is none, he will continue working with his colleagues 
who could be a cyber security. They are working on Security Matrix and trying to hack the matrix. The process could be analyzing what could harm the system,
particularly what kind of threat it is, how many solutions there are, and what it will harm. Then, they put them on the scale level from 1 to 5 (harmless to mostly dangerous)
and then coding to figure it out. Time in the morning is about to work and figure the problem. Time in the afternoon which is meeting, he meets his managers or clients
to keep track on the problem they are working on to let them know that the process is going positively or negatively in order to handle the problem as soon as possible.
Work ends at 3:30, which means 7 and a half hours working at the workplace. The rest of the day, he spends time with his friends and then go to rest. 
It sounds pretty much perfect and not any hurdles for the Professional.

This is video is about a woman IT Professional who is know working as business analyst.
She starts a day from very soon in the morning which is 5:45 A.M to work out. Work out in the morning helps to release all endorphins and stress 
to free your brain and push up your energy for the new day starting. Taking care of her dogs and eating breakfast, checking for emergency emails to reply. 
Although it is just 8:00 A.M in the morning, she has already had a call from her clients. A busy day for the lady from 8 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon
while she needs to be on phone contacting with different clients doing business in IT area. Other days, she can have meetings with her co-workers 
if she does not have any calls. It seems very exhausted for a business analyst in IT area while in the video the lady does not have any time for eating. 
Her lunch was done while she is on her talking on just a little piece of bread. Her work ends at 4:00 P.M and then she just goes straight home to take care of her dogs again.
After arriving home, she still needs to have all her own work done before it is too late in the evening. Like responding emails, edit videos for Youtube channel,
studying more for her jobs or something she likes. Not until doing household like cleaning kitchen with all the mess she left in the morning, she goes to bed before 11:00 P.M.
Because all the IT professional always sleep before 11:00 PM if there is not any hurdle or urgent works need to be done.

A day life of a game programmer. No need to wake very early in the morning because most programmers work at 10:00 A.M which means they have time to sleep more in the morning. 
But in this video, the guy wants to wake up soon because he walks to work instead of driving for a little exercise. A programmer, who most people think they just only code,
they also need to contact with different colleagues in different department to discuss about the project that the company is working. Every 2 hours the programmer will 
take a break, or short break in order to balance health and work. Everyday he needs to code to let the program run as well as the client or senior managers want him to do. 
Then everyday the programmer team will have a short 30-minute meeting to report and review how well the program is running and then fix for the next work. 
After the meeting, programmers will check what they are not sure about they need to ask who in charge on the spot to solve the problem immediately,
for example, after meeting he needs to meet finance department to keep track and question about expenses to manage the project run well but not fail the economy of company. 
Sometimes, because of schedule or how large the project is, their team needs to separate the meeting into 2 to let the other members know about the process. 
Then before going home, the programmer always write down all works that he has done for today in order not to forget and tomorrow he will know what should continue.

Personal Information & Team Profile
My name is Nguyen Hoang Minh Nhat. My student ID is 3765963 so the email address is s3765963@rmit.edu.vn. I am Vietnamese.
Then, just a little bit about myself that I want to write down, that is I am not an introvert. I am lazy whenever nothing can interest me to do but as soon as I like it,
I spend all the time for it, days and nights. I like playing badminton and soccer, but I do not have time and partners to play with, I can be in any group and type of people. 
There is a long story for me about absolutely studying Information Technology. Since I was in grade 11th, I wished that someday I could create something innovative just like
Apple or Microsoft. First it was a dream, then my brother said that IT is one of the most difficult majors in which students graduate very few. At that moment, I was scared, 
I listened to my parents apply into Hospitality in RMIT. Right there, after two semesters studying, I had found myself getting bored because of business.
I found Daniel Shiffman channel who teaches JS, HTML, CSS, ect,.. I admired him and started learning code from him and Processing was the first application which 
I wrote down my first code. Now, I am going to be a Junior then further due to learning all courses in RMIT. I am wondering if RMIT or me or could be both will help me 
to be good at using code to help people. When I tested an online application on a browser about my personality and my learning style, I have recognized a lot of things
about myself which I do not know about until they analyze me. Firstly, it is the 16Personalities testing my traits and the result definitely surprises me.
The result in general is telling me that I am very energetic in everything and working with feelings, following my heart more than following my head. 
I am quite worried about this part of mine. I know that I am judging everything by my feelings but sometimes just following my heart only hurts myself and my life. 
Fortunately, I have not done anything which makes me disappointed yet. Moreover, this test will explain reasonably why I am a tactile/kinesthetic. 
This style of learning is about combining movements and studyings altogether to imagine how the study will flow in my brain. My last test from Big Five, the in the OCEAN, 
I am most of the A which means Agreeableness. It means a person with high A will trust their people, always care about others explaining how sympathetic
I am which means how I am working with feelings more than logic.
