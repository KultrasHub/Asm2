The order of our members has no meaning in this feedback. 
First of all, about Khoa, who is pretty good at coding already, therefore he is a guy who designed our website. 
His coding compared with other members is completely different. Therefore, he usually reminds us to keep track of the assignment.
Second is Kent, he is great in coming up with ideas for the project but his idea is actually kind of impossible for us at this time,
his ideas always big and needs to spend years to complete. Therefore, I will not say it is his weakness, it is great but it is quite not realistic. 
About Phong, he is excellent at explaining all the requests that the assignment asks us to do. 
Thanks to him, our group is not as struggling as we think we will have faced, we are able to understand and get the assignment much easier and clearer. 
Lastly, about myself, I am an absolute neutral. I am like a combination of three of them, not including coding skill, 
I think that I am good at management that breaks down big tasks into small ones in order to let our team have the same amount of work.
