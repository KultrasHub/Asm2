    techText.innerHTML="Cybersecurity is an application of technologies and a process to take controls in order to protect everything relating to Information Technology (IT), for example, systems, networkings, hardware, software, devices and data. All applications of technology relating to security ensures that none of cyber attackers is not be able to access, manipulate, steal data . As soon as cybersecurity is working in the IT industry meaning many types of cyberattacks are prevented. It is a positive signal for not only small but also large business because in the history of IT industry, there were numerous dangerous cyberattacks, for instance, The Melissa Virus happened in 1999, which infected Microsoft Words, that all infected documents were sent randomly via email as attachment. This issue at that time cost Microsoft $80 million in damage. Even though the creator said that he did not do that intentionally, he was still imprisoned; Gonzales, an American hacker from Florida, who robbed tens of millions of credit cards from financial institution and some large companies in 2009 including 7-Eleven, which is one of the biggest business about convenience stores at that time still being robbed; Google China being hit in 2009, at that time many Gmail accounts were being accessed without permissions. Most notorious cyberattacks just happened before 2010 and now it reduced a lot thanks to cybersecurity. Because of those situations, many businesses from small to large are willing to pay a lot of money to secure their system and data. Meanwhile, there are some powerful tools created to help those businesses against viruses. Malwarebytes, which is an application of technology, prevents your applications from Malware or against the issue happening to Microsoft. Malwarebytes offer users three different prices in order to be appropriate for small and large business, it also offers a small price for home business. Mimecast is helpful for small businesses to protect their emails from the external attackings taking credit card numbers and being blackmailed. Bitdefender Total Security, this is recommended for large companies in order to protect your process of online banking while your company wants to transfer a big amount of money. The tools cost you over $40 but it is only half price for those who pay for a whole year applying for 5 devices, especially, Bitdefender Total Security also gives you trial for 30 days. At the moment, there have been a lot of home businesses which are smaller than small businesses, those home businesses usually pay for creating a website without using any cybersecurity. Webroot is a recommended tool for home business because without protection, the cyber attackers can harm your business all the time without warning and noticing .Those 4 suggestions are recommended for all businesses while they are working, it can be paid for the whole year with appropriate price or just only a month with small price. Therefore, in the future there will be more advanced tools that can replace those old applications. Because of the development of technology, new viruses will appear and damage the IT industry in general. Imagining that in the future, those tools would be too old to handle the problem, the new viruses will attack both tools and applications at the same time and create double damage to the programs and systems. Thus, as far as in the future, those tools need to be upgraded by that company or they could create an absolute new one. This can explain the reason why those tools or new applications always cost your businesses an amount of money to not only maintain the tools working correctly but also to develop for the new one or upgrade for the old one.";

    impactText.innerHTML="SInce Cybersecurity is being developed strongly in the IT industry, which affects and resolves numerous problems and huge issues in business including home business, small business, large business. Cybersecurity is the application anti Cyber Attack (CA), CA has caused some problems like stealing company information, disturbing money trading in business to business, especially and dangerously, CA is able to get payment card details of company. Without Cybersecurity, these causes have failed the company and made it become bankrupt. Therefore, the IT department is the one who has full responsibility for this issue because they are people who have interacted with technologies earliest and fastest, they need to have acknowledged about those cyber attackers, the earlier they recognize, the less causes the company takes. Since Cybersecurity is one of the most compulsory parts of a business, it creates a chance for those who want to work in the IT department and have interest in technologies. However, requirements for this position can be stricter and harder than others because it not only requires skills in technology but you also need to follow and keep track on news about technology day by day to get more information about what is happening in the IT industry not to let your company use obsolete technology. Having skills in this position is one of fundamental requirements for interviewees which means everyone can have the same skills and makes this redanduncy. New is better, however, interviewees need to have skills in analysis for applying suitable new technology in the project of the company running or the company will have to lose all of money due to running after new technology all the time causing wasting time, money and human resources. Therefore, Cybersecurity is such an important role which is indispensable for any business from home to small and especially large businesses.";

    perText.innerHTML="Cybersecurity affects those who are using technology directly and also affects those who are not using technology indirectly. I am one of those who are currently using technology in order to get my life more convenient, safer and better. I am currently a student and I am not having any job in any company, thus, most of the time cybersecurity helps me deleting applications before I use it. Many years ago, I did not have any knowledge about viruses that are able to be created in all applications having already been cracked. Therefore, I just used it without thinking of any risks that my laptop would have. Those years, my laptop did not have any anti virus so it usually killed my laptop all the time and needed a whole day to setted laptop up again which wasted a day not doing anything without the laptop. At the moment, I am studying in RMIT, which is the perfect environment for applying Cybersecurity. In university, I need to do a lot of research for my assignments, there are tons of sources while I am researching but some have viruses and have sensitive contents. Thanks to that, I am able to get more reliable information without worrying about any virus killing my laptop or sensitive contents pop up on unreliable websites. Including my family and my friends who suffered all the situations that I mentioned above have the same feelings that Cybersecurity is enormously helpful in our lives. Saying Cybersecurity is important but it is always dangerous because in VietNam, it is still not a big problem and strong policy for those who break the security of private life. There were issues of popular people’s videos being leaked because of weak security and no strong treatment on those who had done it.";

    techText.innerHTML="Nowadays, vehicles have become an essential part of human life. With the development of technology, all car brands in the world are now creating a trend with autonomous vehicles and environmentally-friendly energy. Until now, this kind of technology has brought back a lot of benefits. The most apparent utility that this technology brings is reduced accidents, reduced traffic congestion, and reduced air pollution. According to the USDOT website: 'With 94 percent of fatal vehicle crashes attributable to human error, the potential of autonomous vehicle technologies to reduce deaths and injuries on our roads urges us to action.'. Self-driving cars have the potential in the future to reduce deaths and injuries from car crashes, particularly those that result from driver distraction,' said House Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ). The House Energy and Commerce Committee website clarifies: 'Self-driving cars are projected to reduce traffic deaths by 90%, saving 30,000 lives a year.'. The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) predicts that the rise of driverless cars will see the number of traffic deaths fall drastically. In 2017 it reported 37,133 deaths as a result of vehicle crashes (94% of which are down to human error), so a 90% reduction would save 30,000 lives in a single year. Autonomous cars could eliminate the waves of traffic created by stop-and-go behavior (where humans, rather than road accidents, develop changes in speeds) according to research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This, in turn, will not only save people time but decrease the time their cars are on the roads and therefore reduce emissions. The same Rand report also predicts that lane capacity could increase by a staggering 500%. The State Smart Transportation Initiative only puts this figure at 100% (still an impressive increase), which it says, in turn, could result in a 20% increase in traffic speeds. Obviously, this type of technology has provided significant benefits, but besides that, it has disadvantages with high levels of danger and must be improved in no time. Though it has been successfully programmed, there will still be a possible unexpected glitch that may happen. Technologies are continuously updating, and almost all of this equipment may have a faulty code. Therefore computation and completeness must always be met. Although very modern when integrated with the vehicles, but in general, they are no different from a rudimentary computer prone to hacking. Autonomous vehicles could be the next major target of hackers as this vehicle continuously tracks and monitors the details of the owner. This may lead to a possible collection of personal data. To improve this problem is also very feasible. Fingerprint security or setting a password is the answer. As artificial intelligence continues to overcome the roles and responsibilities of humans, taxis, trucks, or even co-pilots may be laid off as their services will no longer be needed. This may significantly impact the employment rate and economic growth of a certain country. The last drawback that needed to be improved is non-functional sensors. Sensors' failures often happened during drastic weather conditions. This may not work during a blizzard or a heavy snowfall. Our technology still continues to develop and to be tested. Autonomous vehicles may provide a significant comfort we needed. However, we need to bear in mind that there are still disadvantages affiliated with it. All of the above disadvantages are always dangerous to humans but it is not possible to overcome. With the advancement of technology today, machine engineers and programmers are two key factors for creating and developing this type of technology. Besides, the budget is a deciding factor because the more modern the machine is, the more relevant it is required.";

    impactText.innerHTML="Traffic will be the most strongly affected area by this type of technology. The incredibly complicated technology behind self-driving cars lets the onboard computer make hundreds of calculations a second. These include how far you are from objects, current speed, other cars' behavior, and location on the globe. These super-accurate readings have virtually eliminated driving errors for test cars on the road, as the only accidents so far are while human drivers have been in control. Because a vehicle may eventually function as a sort of self-guided train car, the potential for new car designs is enormous. Self-driving vehicles could include new ways to relax or stay entertained with no need for complicated driving tools. The new design opportunities are not limited to the interior; however, and self-driving cars may soon look unrecognizable to vehicles today. Ultimately, some people think cars could become like a high tech living room you kick back in until you reach a destination. Potential For More Powerful Vehicles because self-driving vehicles don't require a driver, technicians could rearrange where the various mechanical parts are stored. This may also lead to cars with more capable and powerful engines. With fewer driver errors, cars could eventually be capable of going much higher speeds.

    perText.innerHTML="Unlike mere mortals, driverless cars don’t require a minimum following distance between vehicles. This means three driverless cars can fit comfortably into the space needed for one vehicle with a driver. Every lane of a motorway or freeway coming into a typical Australian city can accommodate 2000 vehicles per lane per hour. With driverless cars coming in, that could creep up to 6000. Which begs the questions: if you can get more out of one lane that you currently have, why build more lanes or more roads? In my opinion, driverless cars will solve some of the need to build more major roads. I don’t think we’re going to see many new major roads in our cities. About ten years from now, one of the lanes on major roads will be allocated for driverless cars and trucks. That’s going to have implications for fleet management, garbage collection, maintenance, street lighting – the list goes on. The way I see it, riding in an autonomous vehicle, won’t require a license. This opens up a world where the driverless car can drop the kids off at school while Mum and Dad make their own way to work, reducing the school drop-off and pick-up traffic that can cripple cities. For vulnerable members of society, driverless cars will mean freedom. People who have access issues or various medical conditions will now be able to access a car, and they don’t have to depend on the taxi service or relatives. For young families and couples struggling to get a foothold in the city property market, driverless cars will open up areas further and further away from CBDs. This technology is going to change the way the world evolves, and it’s going to change the property market. In Sydney, for example, a lot of younger couples and younger families will be able to buy a home way out at the Blue Mountains, because, on the way to work, they can sit back, have a sleep, or read a paper. I also imagine a scenario where city workers can catch a driverless car or bus to the station, and then transfer to high-speed rail. Retirees could also take advantage of this – those who fear to live too far away from hospitals would be more comfortable spending their twilight years away from the city if they could get to medical appointments quickly and easily. Twenty years on from now, you could find that the Sydney property market may not have such an exorbitant price, because people can live much further out of the city so there won’t be such a demand on the inner areas of Sydney. I also expect that driverless cars will make a massive impact on not just the death toll from road accidents, but on what is sometimes called the ‘hidden road toll’; people who have been maimed and psychologically scarred by road trauma. And, we’re probably going to be surprised by how affordable these high-tech machines will be. Most of these driverless cars are going to be electric. Electric cars require mainly an electric transmission, so they’re not going to have all the components that a petrol or diesel car has. It’s a much more efficient transmission, and it’s a much cheaper production.";

    techText.innerHTML="Machine learning is a subset field of Artificial Intelligence(AI) that involves study and improvement through experience. In other words, via machine learning, computers act without being explicitly programmed. Computers learn and discover from the provided information. Machine learning exists in many different forms , it gives us self-driving vehicles, effective research and browsing. It is pervasive in our world, think about millions of customers who buy thousands of online products daily, there are plenty of transactions. However, people do not buy randomly, they purchase certain subsets of products based on their necessities. This is the part where machine learning comes to use, it gathers information of every single customer and determines the factors hidden behind consumers' behaviour. For this action, computers will find the potential customers for certain products. Consequently, products get sold and consumers have what they need more effectively. Experts believe that machine learning is the best formula in making progress toward a world with no famine, no global issues or it can be said that a better living environment.Machine learning is one of the fastest growing fields of computer science. Researchers are finding new solutions to turn dormant information into useful products and services. According to the NCBI, Machine Learning will be critical for practicing medicine. For example, via patient-level observations, machine learning could join as a part of the diagnosis process, they are believed to give more reliable prediction. The second application of Machine Learning is in agriculture, most of agriculture technology is diverted to machine learning algorithms on the purpose of maximizing crop fields while minimizing inputs. Computers will enhance the crop's production through calculated selection and upcoming diseases. Additionally, machine learning is a powerful tool that provides farmers the right management, irrigation and detection. Many prominent AI researchers like Ray Kurzweii and Eliezer Yudkowshy, conclude in the book called our final invention, that AI as the name suggests is our final invention. Imagine a world where computers could learn and invent new creations billions of times faster than humans, there would be nothing that we actually need to create. Through self-improvement, machines could outpass our understanding and eventually our lives will be automated. In the short future, scientists believe that machine learning is a huge opportunity to change human society and reduce poverty and inequality drastically. Firstly, machine learning will have a significant impact on economic development, as human forces are gradually replaced by machines, initial cost for employees will decrease. This will lead to the lower-price product yet, better quality. For this reason,  cases of famine and poverty are less likely to occur. Moreover, Artificial intelligence would enable us to find the best solutions for energy crises. More effective and cost-efficient means of generating power would be discovered by AI. Machine Learning has been around us for decades, however, they are narrow AI which means they are only capable of doing the predictable task. We have not seen a chess AI, which could learn all strategies, starts to learn ,for example, baking. Computers have all the information on the internet and they know it all. To illustrate, a human with all that information he could potentially reshape the world, conversely, a computer having that much data in its memory may not do anything outside of the given task. Therefore, the first obstacle of this development is the process of turning information into usable knowledge. Data is generated every second, it grows larger and larger daily and to keep up with this serious extension, higher data storage should be considered.";
    impactText.innerHTML="Machine learning has coexisted with humans for decades, therefore, many researchers believe that Machine learning will have a dramatic effect on our daily life. Machine learning would change the economy, solve our global issue and enable us to become a galactic species. Many aspects of life will be completely different than it is, for example, we may have an AI teacher, who could be supervising students all the time. To the economic structure, the whole system may be entirely modified, there may be no workers and machines are in control of the place. This results in higher productivity but lower initial cost and the products could be cheaper. Consequently, the products become more attractive to society and businesses will have more opportunities to grow. Let's have another look in the science field, a computer that has a profound insight surpassing all humans on earth could multiply itself to thousands of copies and we will have a no man army of researchers. This army is more willing to take fatal examinations which humans hesitate, as a result, science would advance to a level out of our imagination. However, the whole community is the one to be most affected, due to the change in trends, lifestyles with no preparation like businessmen or scientists. More sci-fi concepts would be taken into consideration, humans one days merge themselves with technology. It may seem unacceptable to some people, however, this also makes them behind others. On a smaller scale, we may have smart facilities that adapt and update usually to suit everyone. Imagine when you go shopping, a cart automatically follows you and navigates the direct way to get the tools you need. Overall, the society will be the most affected. In the past decades, few jobs have been taken by machine and this trend is continuing but with a higher rate. Physical works have the highest chance of being taken out by AI, then works related to optimization will be the next target, including journalists, reporters, analysts and even teachers. Only the creative jobs are the one in clear protection.";
    perText.innerHTML="I do not have a positive sentiment toward this technology, it is not about the loss of jobs, it is the loss of meaning that makes me uncomfortable in this scenario. We, humans, work is the reason we existed, the ethic we find supply and raise the family has been around since first life on earth emerged. Work is the reason I go to school, the reason I study hard, the reason I connect to strangers and the loss of work does mean I could just entertain and leave work to computers. It is not the future I may want, there is no competition, no reason to make an effort. The life there is not comfortable at least to the one who wants adventure like me. Life would be mundane. Secondly, it would be strange if a high-tech species, robot with advanced machine learning technology, works for humans. We take advantage of other animals because we are smarter but the same story will not be true to AI. In the far future, I wonder whether humans are in control of the world or become pets or test samples of AI like what we did to lower intelligent animals. However, I would at least feel the fantasy of this development as I am still a fan of sci-fi. A near future seems promising to me, I may have an assistant that never betrays me, a supporter in study and life. Then my achievements would be different. I think how smart and AI is, it would never be a real human and can not replace friends and family. Therefore, I hope my friends and family would never abandon any members since they have a machine friend. In my opinion, my parents would be the ones left behind by this development as they are not adaptive to such significant changes, so, I believe their lives would not be much different to this life.";
